## Overview
Kyber is built upon the M-LWE assumption, from which Kyber derives a IND-CPA PKE scheme.

In order to reduce its bandwith, the real Kyber.PKE compresses its ciphertext and public key,
claiming that without lossing its security and correctness.

Finally, Kyber applys FO transformation with implicit rejection to Kyber.PKE, also with a slight tweak.
This gives IND-CCA Kyber.KEM.
